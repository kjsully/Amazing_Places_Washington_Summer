                    <p>Catch a ferry (or take the long way around) and head west for a day trip along the coast of the Pacific Ocean. Northwest beaches are known for their marine life (cute af seals) as well as their rocky terrain and breathtaking sunsets.</p>

                    <p>The Mariners might not win, but check out that view! Boasting a retractable roof (no rain delays!), T-Mobile Park is a majestic stadium that can easily take 9 innings to explore. The food, while not cheap, will make-up somewhat for the on-field product.</p>

                    <p>No visit to the great state of Washington would be complete without a trip to the awe-inspiring Mt. Rainier. Constantly looming behind the Seattle skyline, the giant mountain (and active volcano) serves as a reminder of nature's tremendous power and history.</p>

                    <p>Nestled right in between Seattle and Bellevue, and spanning 22 miles north-to-south, Lake Washington is Seattle's go-to destination for cooling off in the summer. You're likely to find swimmers aplenty at any of the numerous Lake WA beaches during the summer months.</p>

                    <p>More mountains, yay! They're hard to escape, especially on the drive from Spokane to Seattle, and vice versa. One that particular route, one would be gifted a front-row seat to some of the state's most impressive peaks.</p>

                    <p>Ah, yes. The iconic Space Needle. The destination for thousands of tourists each year - for good reason, too. The 500+ ft tower looms above the north end of downtown, offering spectacular views. Fun fact: did you know the top actually rotates once per hour?</p>

                    <p>For those spending time on the eastern part of the state, spending a day on the Spokane River is a great way to escape the dry heat during summertime. Locals frequent the winding path, and groups float all the way down on cheap innertubes.</p>
