                    <p>The Mariners might not win, but check out that view! Boasting a retractable roof (no rain delays!), T-Mobile Park is a majestic stadium that can easily take 9 innings to explore. The food, while not cheap, will make-up somewhat for the on-field product.</p>

                    <p>Nestled right in between Seattle and Bellevue, and spanning 22 miles north-to-south, Lake Washington is Seattle's go-to destination for cooling off in the summer. You're likely to find swimmers aplenty at any of the numerous Lake WA beaches during the summer months.</p>
